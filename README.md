## Hello!
---
Hi! I'm a young coder who is ~~not~~ good at math. I like to do math, coding, and games for fun.

## Fun Facts!
Joined [Github](https://github.com): 12/2/2022 (I never really used this before!)
Please view my projects, any feedback would be helpful :)
As you can probably tell, I'm not very good at md, I mainly do NodeJS/Express or Django/Python for websites. I also know C++/Java/Python for regular coding as well.
