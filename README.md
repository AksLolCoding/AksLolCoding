## Hello!
---
Hi! I'm a young coder in middle school who is good at math (just 5 grades accelerated, not much!) I like to do math, coding, and games for fun.

## Fun Facts!
Joined [Github](https://github.com): 12/2/2021 (I never really used this before!)
Please view my projects, any feedback would be helpful :)
As you can probably tell, I'm not very good at Markdown, I mainly do Node.JS/HTML/JS/CSS or Flask/Django/Python for websites. I also do C++/Java/Python for regular coding as well.
I'm on [USACO](https://usaco.org) (which I use C++ for, BTW), and I am kind of okay at it? IDK how good gold rank is.

### Other Coding Accounts
